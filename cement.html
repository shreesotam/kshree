<div id="scemintro"><p>Shivam cements which was established in 2009 is a largest manufacturing Greenfield project in Nepal with an aim to produce 1250 TPD from the company’s self owned limestone.

At present, where there are many other large companies to compete with, one may ask why Shivam and why not others? It is because Shivam cement, a private company with a minimum of 4 billion enterprises, is Nepal’s biggest and most modern cement manufacturing plant.  It is situated at the industrial hub Hetauda, where rapid infrastructural development has been witnessed over the years. Shivam cement has invested hugely on capitals, human resources, production processes, infrastructures, etc.  making it one of the largest cement manufacturing plants in Nepal. The tonnage capacity of machinery that is installed and erected on the plant site for the manufacture of cement is one of the biggest Green field projects across the country. Produced from high –grade raw materials extracted from self- owned lime mine, our company delivers world class quality that will offer the choice of high quality cement for builders, project owners and creative architects.  In Addition to its intensity, durability and flexibility, Shivam cements offers innumerable opportunities for sustainable design.</p>
<p>Ordinary Portland cement is the most usual type of cement that is widely used around the world.  OPC was developed from natural cement made in Britain at the commencement of the 18th century.  The most common purpose of OPC is in the production of concrete.  Concrete is a composite fabric consisting of aggregate, i.e. Gravel, sand, cement powder and water.  As a constructing material, concrete can be cast in almost any form, which is desired, and once it is hard it can be structural element.  Concrete can be employed in the construction of structural elements like panels, beams, for building superstructures like roads and damns. OPC is also used in fillings for plasters and screeds and in residues.  OPC is manufactured by burning siliceous materials like limestone at 1400 degree Celsius and thereafter grinding it with gypsum it is made up in the form of different grades, the most common in Nepal is a Grade – 53 and grade 43.</p>
